Summary

I'm a developer who has been working with ruby for the last 2 years, but
started learning and developing as an amateur about 9 years ago. I enjoy
learning and using new technologies when I have the chance.

I'm focused on web development using ruby web frameworks. On the latest
projects I've been using rails for full-stack applications and grape for API backends.
I'm familiar with RESTful web services. Many of the projects I've worked on
require consuming third party services through a APIs.

As for development cycles, I'm familiar with agile methodologies. I've worked on projects with short iterations,
and daily communication with the team, project managers and customers.

Among the tools and practices I use everyday I can enumerate:
 - Git version control system. As a team, we contribute our code based on a
   pull request / review / merge flow, to ensure code quality.
 - Test driven development. I use RSpec as my testing framework for writing
   all types of tests for my applications.
 - Refactoring. When some part of the application starts growing I rely on tests
   to have the freedom to change the code and classes/modules responsabilities.
 - Pair programming.
 - Code quality tools and services. Rubocop, CodeClimate.

I've contributed to the following open source projects:
 - Active Force (https://github.com/ionia-corporation/active_force)
 - Ruby MQTT (https://github.com/njh/ruby-mqtt)
 - Mosca (https://github.com/antico5/mosca)
 - Xively client libraries (https://github.com/ionia-corporation/xively_api_client)
